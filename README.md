# Peg-Jump-Game

Code containing a peg jump game created by me in C/C++(google peg jump for further details). Simple game, and the directions to play is in the code. The inputs are very flexiable, not case sentivitve, no spacing errors, and checks your input. Code will need to be compiled by user in order to be used.This was made on Visual Studios on Windows 10.
